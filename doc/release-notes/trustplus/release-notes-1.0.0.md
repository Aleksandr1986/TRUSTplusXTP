How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/TRUSTplus-Qt (on Mac) or
trustplusd/trustplus-qt (on Linux).

**This new version uses transaction indexing by default, you will need to reindex 
the blockchain. To do so, start the client with --reindex.**
